**Validation Set Methods**
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that provide various methods for creating validation sets in machine learning projects. The methods include different strategies for splitting datasets into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring that your model can be properly evaluated and generalized.

**Contents**
validation_set_method_1.ipynb: Description of the first validation set method and implementation.
validation_set_method_2.ipynb: Another validation strategy.
cross_validation_method.ipynb: Implementation of cross-validation methods.
stratified_validation.ipynb: Stratified splitting methods to preserve class distribution.
Setup and Requirements
